# --- PROMPT FOR CODING AGENT (ENTIRE FILE: CORE REMESHING ALGORITHM) ---
# TASK: This entire file is a placeholder for your sophisticated remeshing algorithm.
# DETAILS:
#   - This is where the "magic" of Evolver Remesher will live.
#   - It will take a BMesh (or mesh data) and `EvolverRemesherSettings` as input.
#   - It needs to output new mesh data (verts, faces) or modify the BMesh in-place.
#   - Consider an object-oriented approach: a `Remesher` class that encapsulates state and methods.
#   - Key algorithmic components to implement based on architectural plan:
#     - Sharp Feature Graph Construction: Using marked edges (from BMesh) and settings.
#     - Initial Surface Parameterization / Patching (if applicable).
#     - Point Sampling / Seeding on the surface, respecting features and density maps.
#     - Mesh Generation: Connecting points to form quads/tris, aligning to features and curvature.
#       - Algorithms: Quad Dominant (e.g., based on cross-fields), Isotropic Remeshing, Voxel-based approaches (like OpenVDB then surface extraction).
#     - Optimization/Relaxation: Improving element quality, edge flow, adherence to surface.
#     - Projection: Ensuring new mesh stays on the original surface.
#     - Symmetry Handling.
#     - Guide Curve Influence.
#     - Adaptive Density (from vertex groups/colors).
#     - Boundary Handling.
#     - Data Transfer (UVs, VCols, etc.) - might be a separate module called from here.
#
# CHALLENGES:
#   - This is extremely complex and research-intensive.
#   - Performance will be a major concern in Python. Heavy parts may need C/C++.
#   - Robustness across all mesh types and edge cases.
#
# INTERFACE (Example):
# def perform_remeshing(context, input_bmesh, settings, original_object):

#     if success:
#         return (new_verts_list, new_faces_list) # For non-destructive
#         # Or, if modifying input_bmesh in-place for destructive:
#         # return True
#     else:
#         return None # Or False for destructive
